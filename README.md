# PlotPower-Matplotlib
### The Power Of Plots
#### Project Description -->  To access the data from a recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

#### Resources:
   * Folder Pymaceuticals: This folder contains 
      * data: Contains the data files 'Mouse_metadata.csv' and 'Study_results.csv'
         *Jupyter notebook 'pymaceuticals.ipynb' that has main script to run for analyzing the data stored in csv files of 'data' folder.
        * Please find Observations or inferences made from the data at the top of notebook.
#### Key notes:
   * The report successfully displays 
      * A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
      * Identical bar plots using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study
      * Identical pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
	* Calculates the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.      
	* Calculates the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.      
	* A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
      * A line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse that was treated with Capomulin.
      * A plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
      * The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 
	* A plot for linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
	* Three observations or inferences that can be made from the data at the top of notebook.
 
## Used proper labeling of plots, to include properties such as: plot titles, axis labels, legend labels, x-axis and y-axis limits, etc.
* Dataframes were accurately created, grouped.
* Aggregate functions were accurately applied
*  DataFrame was structured to have the right x-axis and y-axis
•  How do I build a basic scatter plot?
•  How do I add a label to that scatter plot?
•  Where would the labels for that scatter plot come from?


#### Execution:
  * Important : Please download the repository.
  * The script is in the Jupyter notebook 'pymaceuticals.ipynb' which can be located in the folder 'Pymaceuticals'.
  * The file has detailed comments explaining each segment.
    
#### Results:
   * Tested it multiple times in Jupyter Notebook and VS code.
   * All the segments of Jupyter notebook executed successfully generating the final report.
   * Successfully displays output.
